# ðŸŸ¢ S4U2Self Attack

S4U2Self (Service for User to Self) is an extension that allows a service to obtain a service ticket (TGS) on behalf of a user to itself.

### S4U2Self Attack

The S4U2Self Attack exploits the S4U2Self extension in Kerberos authentication.&#x20;

This extension is designed to allow a service to obtain a service ticket on behalf of a user, without requiring the user's credentials.&#x20;

In a S4U2Self Attack, an attacker with control over a compromised service can abuse this feature to impersonate any user in the system, even those with higher privileges.&#x20;

This can potentially lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or systems within a network.
